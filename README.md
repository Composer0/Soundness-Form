Had to create an application based on Fitness, feature Physical Security, with the client being drivers.

Sales pitch was the following:


##Pitch
Attn: Board of Education

School Bus Drivers are a commodity in our current climate. Each time they turn the key, they are responsible for the safety of your children and the safety of all the people they share the road with.  This requires them to be in top driving performance so that they are alert to changes in traffic and can make quick decisions. Because making the right decision saves lives.
Our program is used to measure our Bus Driver’s wellbeing to ensure they are physically and mentally healthy enough to safely perform the demanding task of keeping our most precious commodity safe.
In addition to our program logging your drivers’ work vehicle and personnel assets, our program will be able to assess your drivers’ wellbeing through an eval that will request their age, height, weight, health conditions, stress levels, causes of stress and the ability to express their needs.
Upon completion, this information is submitted to a SQL server that logs the information of each driver and is designed to protect the driver’s vehicle, property, information, personnel asset. This information is then later evaluated to provide a broad analysis of how your districts drivers and their well-being to allow you to implement policies that can positively assist them in providing options to help your drivers stay healthy and a safely performing their routes.


##Explanation
Fitness relates to both physical and mental states.
Physical Security would the gathering of information and keeping it private. Keep in mind for this project we want the information to be visible for walkthrough purposes.
Driver as a client was manipulated slightly as they are indeed the intended users of the programs that will be implemented app. Ideally the District will pay a subscription fee in order for drivers to take advantage of our offerings.
